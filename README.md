# Chronos documentation

This is the documentation for the chronos application. 
Here we detail the inner workings of our api and data structure.

## Syntax 

As a base we make use of [googles markdown styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html). Besides that this repository uses special markdown syntax that helps style the resulting web version of the documentation.

#### Linking

For linking we make use of the github standard. This means a path-based system. We make sure that every link is started from the root, thus every link has to start with a `/`

#### Alerts

For alerts we make use of the github standard. We make use of the following alerts:

- Note
- Warning
- Danger

> **Note**  
> This is a note alert

> **Warning**  
> This is a warning alert

> **Danger**  
> This is a danger alert
